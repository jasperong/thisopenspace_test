##### Notes

---

There are two branches on this repo. The master branch has a button to load more data, while the `infinite-scroll` branch has some basic infinite scroll functionality built in to it. To make it easier for you to view, I've deployed both branches on to separate heroku apps:

[With Load Button](https://thisopenspace-jasper-test.herokuapp.com/)
[Infinite Scroll](https://thisopenspace-jasper-infinite.herokuapp.com/)
